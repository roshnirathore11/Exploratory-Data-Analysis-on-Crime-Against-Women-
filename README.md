The main aim of the project was to analyse the situation of women in the year 2001-2014.
We also did a deep analysis through charts and by raising important questions. Let us go through some of the important analysis, we have done through thid project -
      1)More than 5 million females has been a victim of some or other type of Violance, based on their gender, 
      starting from rape to importing them for buisness. 
      2) We concluded from the series of bar graphs that 2014 was the year, when crimes were reported the highest 
      under each category.
      3) We tried finding out the top 10 highest cases reported ever, along with year in which has been reported 
      and in which state.Where, Madhya Pradesh having highest number of cases of rape in 2014, Uttar Pradesh having 
      highest cases in Dowry death in 2014, West Bengal having highest cases in Domestic Violance in 2014 and Bihar 
      having the highest cases in importaion of girls in 2011.
      4)We summarised the TOTAL number of cases happening, in 2001-2014, by each state.
      5)We also found out the top 5 states where maximum number of TOTAL cases has been reported from 2001-2014, 
      state   wise.
      6)We also merged the data in two different cases, first one being "Maximum number of rape cases" and 
      "Maximum number of Importation cases", where we found out it is Madhya Pradesh and in second one being 
      "Maximum number of rape cases" and "Maximum number of Deaths due to Dowry cases", which we concluded to
